There was probably some good hash collision solution idk, but 
we were given 128 tries to get 64 correct answers. And on every wrong try
the thing directly told us what it wanted, so...

Just go through the `./solve.py` script, there was nothing to do

```sh
Success! 64/64 valid tokens verified

Congratulations! You beat the challenge!
